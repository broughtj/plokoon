## Plokoon

This is a (_very_) simple plugin for Neovim written in Lua. 

While developing the plugin put it in a path somewhere, say:

```
$ pwd
/mnt/c/Users/tyler/USU/Research/Computing/Lua/plokoon
```

Then to test it's use, do the following:

```
$ nvim --cmd 'set rtp+=/mnt/c/Users/tyler/USU/Research/Computing/Lua/plokoon'
```

Then when it is ready for prime time, put it in a github repo and use `minpac` to install it.
